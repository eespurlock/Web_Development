Before I tell you about my final project, I would like to thank you for an amazing quarter!
I really learned a lot and I LOVED your class!

Relevant Files Included:

index.html: the html file that you will need to open to run my program
stocks.css: the css file with all of the styling elements
stocks.js: my js React code

(there are other files included that you can ignore)

In case my design is not clear, here is how my web page is set up:

Begin with the 2 input text fields:

One is for Stock Symbol (the 3-4 letter code of the stock you want to buy)
	(the code will work if it is either upper or lower case)
	(if you have a typo or forget to type in one of the fields, it will NOT break my code!)

One is for you to specify how much of that stock you want to buy
	(if you want to sell your stocks, type in a negative number here)
	(if you get below 0 stocks owned, the stock will still display in your portfolio, but will show you as owning 0 stocks)

Once you have filled in both fields, hit the "Buy Stocks!" button and the stock will appear in Your Portfolio

If you want to reset the stocks you have, you can use the "Clear Your Portfolio" button

Your stocks are displayed in the Your Portfolio section

The column headers are all buttons. Pressing on one of the buttons will sort the list by that column.
You can toggle between ascending and descending order by pressing the same button multiple times

Error notes: When I run this and look at the console, I always see a bunch of errors pop up, but the output is always what I want,
so I have been ignoring them. If they are something I should have focused on more, please let me know.
